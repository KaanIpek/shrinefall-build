# shrinefall-build

The build pipeline for **Shrinefall**, a top-down pixel-art action RPG for iOS by RLD Games.

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow and nothing else. **There is no game code here.**

## What it does

Unity runs on the developer's Windows machine, where the Unity licence is active, and emits an Xcode
project. That project is encrypted, split into chunks and pushed to a payload branch of this
repository. The workflow here runs on a macOS runner - the only place `xcodebuild` exists - and
decrypts the payload, archives, signs, exports and uploads the build to TestFlight.

The split exists because Unity Personal licences can no longer be activated in CI, and because
GitHub's macOS runners are free on public repositories. Keeping the pipeline public and the source
private is what makes both true at once.

## What is in the payload

An encrypted archive (`openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2`) of a generated Xcode project. The key is a
repository secret and is never written to a file, a log or a commit. The contents are proprietary:
see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Holding an encrypted payload grants no right to decrypt it.

## Secrets this workflow needs

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `PAYLOAD_KEY` | Passphrase that decrypts the build payload |
| `ASC_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API key id |
| `ASC_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect issuer id |
| `ASC_KEY_P8_B64` | Base64 of the App Store Connect `.p8` key - must have the **Admin** role, because App Manager cannot create a distribution certificate |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Ten-character Apple team id |

No certificate, `.p8` or password is committed to this repository, and the workflow prints none of
them.

## Licence

The workflow, the scripts and the game they build are proprietary - all rights reserved. See
[LICENSE](LICENSE). The third-party art, audio, fonts and Unity packages the game ships with keep
their own licences; they are itemised in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).
